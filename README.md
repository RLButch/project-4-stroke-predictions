**Project Description**    

A stroke is a medical emergency. A stroke happens when blood cannot get to your brain, because of a blocked or burst artery. As a result, your brain cells die due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients.
Symptoms of stroke include trouble walking, speaking and understanding, as well as paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg.
Early treatment with medication like tPA (clot buster) can minimise brain damage. Other treatments focus on limiting complications and preventing additional strokes. Therefore intervention or understanding risk factors for stroke occurence is an important topic within the healthcare system. The objective of this project is to use machine learning to develop an early detection model for strokes. This will be based in causative factors determined during a deep dive into the dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

**Data Overview**    

The dataset used for stroke incidence was drawn from a compliation of patients medical records. It encompasses wide ranging information including patient medical histories, demographics, lifestyle factors and the presence or absence of a stroke for each patient.

Here is a snippet of the dataset:    


**Resources:**     

This project was built with:  
Python Packages (eg. scikit-learn, matplotlib, searborn, etc.)     
pickle     
Flask     
Javascript, D3      
HTML  
CSS  

**Approach:**    

Identify data sources and dependencies  
Perform EDA, determine feature set and transform stroke data  
Compile, train and evaluate the model  
Compare models for optimization of accuracy metric  
Store the transformed dataset into pickle
Create Flask App, import data in via pickle and connect routes to model  
Create interactive web app using Javascript D3, html and css
